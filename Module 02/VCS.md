####Definition:
The practice of tracking and providing control over the changes made to source code.

**The need for managing software versions has existed as long as there's been software.**
Version control is commonly used to keep track of various pieces of source code.

**Is essential for development teams.**

As software development has become more team-based, teams become more distributed.
In distributed version control, there is no centralized repository.
It is up to the owner of the repository to merge different version together
if he so chooses.

Versions of "Snapshots" are stored, and this version can be rolled back at any time.
